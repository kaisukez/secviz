## What is SECVIZ
SECVIZ stands for *security visualization* which is a class
in computer engineering at Kasetsart University.

## What I've done
I created a static website to visualize...
- [Thailand Internet Map](http://internet.nectec.or.th/webstats/internetmap.current.iir?Sec=internetmap_current) for both domestic and international internet map
- Login log at Kasetsart University
- Traffic log at Kasetsart University  

But for performance reason, there will be no Traffic Log on my website.

## What I've learned
- Learned to visualize something using Echarts library.
- Learned to use css grid and media query to (try to) create responsive website.
